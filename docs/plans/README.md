#### Daily Standup Process (Automated)

```yaml
Daily Standup Configuration:
  Time: 9:00 AM (Configurable timezone)
  Duration: 15 minutes maximum
  Participants: All active agents + Human oversight
  
  Automated Standup Flow:
    1. Agent Status Collection (5 minutes):
       - Each agent reports current task status
       - Progress percentage and blockers
       - Estimated completion time
       - Dependencies and handoffs needed
    
    2. Conflict Resolution (5 minutes):
       - Identify blocking dependencies
       - Resource conflicts and resolution
       - Priority adjustments needed
       - Human escalation requirements
    
    3. Daily Planning (5 minutes):
       - Task assignments and redistributions
       - New priorities and urgent items
       - Human interaction scheduling
       - Risk assessments and mitigation

  Human Interaction Points:
    - Receive automated standup summary
    - Review flagged items requiring attention
    - Approve priority changes and resource allocation
    - Schedule additional meetings if needed

  Escalation Triggers:
    - Critical blockers affecting sprint goals
    - Budget overruns or timeline risks
    - Quality issues below threshold
    - Agent conflicts requiring human decision
```

```

#### Human Interaction Interface Design

```yaml
Human Oversight Dashboard:
  Real-time Monitoring:
    - Live agent activity feed
    - Current sprint progress visualization
    - Cost tracking and budget alerts
    - Quality metrics dashboard
    - Risk assessment indicators
  
  Decision Queue:

    - Timeline adjustment requests
  
  Communication Interface:
    - Chat with individual agents or teams
    - Video conference capability for complex discussions
    - Document collaboration for requirements
    - Approval workflow for major decisions
    - Emergency stop button for critical situations

Chat Interface with Agents:
  Features:
    - Natural language communication with any agent
    - Context-aware conversations with project history
    - File sharing and collaborative editing
    - Screen sharing for technical discussions
    - Meeting scheduling and agenda management
  
  Example Conversations:
    Human: "Network Engineer Agent, I'm concerned about the current server performance. Can you analyze and recommend solutions?"
    
    Network Agent: "I've been monitoring server performance and identified three bottlenecks:
    1. Database queries averaging 2.3s response time
    2. CDN cache hit ratio at 67% (target: 85%+)
    3. Load balancer showing uneven distribution
    
    Recommended immediate actions:
    - Implement query optimization (Database Expert Agent coordinating)
    - Update CDN cache policies (estimated 4 hours)
    - Rebalance load distribution (estimated 2 hours)
    
    Total estimated cost: $45 in compute time
    Expected performance improvement: 40-60%
    
    Should I proceed with implementation?"
```

Cost Optimization Strategies:
  1. Dynamic Model Assignment:
     - Task complexity analysis determines model tier
     - Real-time cost monitoring and adjustment
     - Model degradation with quality gates
     - Automatic model upgrades for critical tasks
  
  2. Context Length Optimization:
     - Intelligent context pruning
     - Sliding window for long conversations
     - Summarization for historical context
     - Context caching for repeated operations
  
  3. Batch Processing:
     - Group similar tasks for efficiency
     - Queue management for cost optimization
     - Off-peak processing for non-urgent tasks
     - Bulk operations where possible
  
  4. Local Model Integration:
     - Ollama deployment for simple tasks
     - Hybrid cloud-local processing
     - Sensitive data processing locally
     - Cost reduction for high-volume operations
```

#### Daily Standup Process (Automated)

```yaml
Daily Standup Configuration:
  Time: 9:00 AM (Configurable timezone)
  Duration: 15 minutes maximum
  Participants: All active agents + Human oversight
  
  Automated Standup Flow:
    1. Agent Status Collection (5 minutes):
       - Each agent reports current task status
       - Progress percentage and blockers
       - Estimated completion time
       - Dependencies and handoffs needed
    
    2. Conflict Resolution (5 minutes):
       - Identify blocking dependencies
       - Resource conflicts and resolution
       - Priority adjustments needed
       - Human escalation requirements
    
    3. Daily Planning (5 minutes):
       - Task assignments and redistributions
       - New priorities and urgent items
       - Human interaction scheduling
       - Risk assessments and mitigation

  Human Interaction Points:
    - Receive automated standup summary

    - Document collaboration for requirements
    - Approval workflow for major decisions
    - Emergency stop button for critical situations

Chat Interface with Agents:
  Features:
    - Natural language communication with any agent
    - Context-aware conversations with project history
    - File sharing and collaborative editing
    - Screen sharing for technical discussions
    - Meeting scheduling and agenda management
  
  Example Conversations:
    Human: "Network Engineer Agent, I'm concerned about the current server performance. Can you analyze and recommend solutions?"
    
    Network Agent: "I've been monitoring server performance and identified three bottlenecks:
    1. Database queries averaging 2.3s response time
    2. CDN cache hit ratio at 67% (target: 85%+)
    3. Load balancer showing uneven distribution
    
    Recommended immediate actions:
    - Implement query optimization (Database Expert Agent coordinating)
    - Update CDN cache policies (estimated 4 hours)
    - Rebalance load distribution (estimated 2 hours)
    
    Total estimated cost: $45 in compute time
    Expected performance improvement: 40-60%
    
    Should I proceed with implementation?"

Cost Optimization Strategies:
  1. Dynamic Model Assignment:
     - Task complexity analysis determines model tier
     - Real-time cost monitoring and adjustment
     - Model degradation with quality gates
     - Automatic model upgrades for critical tasks
  
  2. Context Length Optimization:
     - Intelligent context pruning
     - Sliding window for long conversations
     - Summarization for historical context
     - Context caching for repeated operations
  
  3. Batch Processing:
     - Group similar tasks for efficiency
     - Queue management for cost optimization
     - Off-peak processing for non-urgent tasks
     - Bulk operations where possible
  
  4. Local Model Integration:
     - Ollama deployment for simple tasks
     - Hybrid cloud-local processing
     - Sensitive data processing locally
     - Cost reduction for high-volume operations
